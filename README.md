Hello! Iâ€™m currently a rising fourth-year honours electrical engineering student at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. My interest areas are communication systems, hardware, personal electronics and machine learning. I have conducted novel research in the field of heterogeneous integrated systems and had a paper presented at the IEEE ISCAS Conference in May 2022. This summer, I am excited to start my corporate journey with DUST Identity, a startup in Boston! When I'm not engineering things, I love to go skiing and when the snow melts I make do with hiking!
